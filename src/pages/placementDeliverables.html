                <h3>Outline of Placement Deliverable and Evidence of Decision Making</h3>
                <p>
                    During my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement at AKA Studio, the primary deliverable was the development of the AI Colour Management System, a comprehensive tool designed to enhance colour accuracy and consistency across various platforms. The system encompassed three main modules: Colour Gear, Colour Converter, and Colour Grab. Each module aimed to address specific challenges faced by designers in the creative industry.
                </p>
                <h4>Deliverables</h4>
                <p>
                    The Colour Gear module focused on creating harmonious colour palettes using advanced algorithms based on colour theory principles. The Colour Converter module was designed to ensure accurate conversion between different colour formats, such as RGB, HEX, CMYK, HSL, and HSV. The Colour Grab module provided real-time colour recognition and capture using the device's camera. Additionally, comprehensive documentation and training materials were created to support users in effectively utilizing the system.
                </p>

                </div>
                <h4>Key Decisions and Justifications</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the critical decisions made during the project was the choice of algorithm for the Colour Gear module. We opted for a well-known colour harmony algorithm to ensure reliability and ease of implementation. Alternatives such as developing a custom algorithm were considered, but they were deemed time-consuming and prone to errors. The selected algorithm provided a balance between accuracy and development efficiency, making it the best choice for our objectives.
                </p>
                <!-- Image placeholder for algorithm decision -->
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/feedback.jpg" alt="Algorithm Decision">
                </div>
                <p>
                    For the Colour Converter module, the decision to implement real-time conversion was driven by user feedback. Initial designs considered batch processing, but real-time conversion offered a more seamless user experience. This choice necessitated optimizing the algorithm for performance, but it ultimately improved the tool's usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Colour Grab module's integration with the device's camera involved selecting a robust image processing library. After evaluating several options, we chose OpenCV for its comprehensive features and strong community support. This decision was justified by the need for reliable and efficient colour detection capabilities.
                </p>
                <h4>Verification and Validation</h4>
                <p>
                    To verify the deliverables, we conducted extensive testing, including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the complete system. User testing sessions were also held to gather feedback and ensure the tools met user needs. These tests confirmed the accuracy of colour conversions and the usability of the interfaces. Additionally, stress testing was performed to ensure the system could handle high volumes of data without performance degradation.
                </p>
                <h4>Meeting Objectives</h4>
                <p>
                    The deliverables successfully met the requirements outlined in the planning report. The Colour Gear module facilitated effortless creation of harmonious palettes, the Colour Converter ensured accurate format conversions, and the Colour Grab provided reliable real-time colour capture. These outcomes were validated through testing and user feedback, confirming the project's success in achieving its objectives.

                <h4>Timeline and Budget</h4>
                <p>
                    All deliverables were completed on time and within budget. Effective project management practices, such as regular progress reviews and risk assessments, contributed to this achievement. Any deviations from the initial plan were promptly addressed, ensuring the project stayed on track. Additionally, budget management strategies, such as prioritizing essential features and optimizing resource allocation, were crucial in maintaining financial constraints.
                </p>
                <h4>Continuous Improvement</h4>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on the project, I identified areas for improvement, such as earlier and more frequent user engagement to refine design decisions. Moving forward, I plan to enhance my project management skills and continue developing my technical expertise through additional training and collaborative projects. This will involve participating in workshops and seminars focused on the latest industry trends and technologies. Furthermore, I aim to stay updated with advancements in AI and machine learning to incorporate innovative solutions into future projects.
